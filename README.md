# super-duper-carnival
Test Mason Dill (mjd159) and Scott Sullivan (scs128) present you with the greatest project, this side of the Mississippi, for CPMINF0010 week 7!

## What is does
DoSomethingâ„¢ takes a *phrase* and a *key* between 0 and 26. The shift function then takes that name and *shifts* the letters by the *key* number, for example if *key* is 2 and the *phrase* is 'a': ('a' + 2 -> 'c')

'z' would become 'b' because when it overflows it loops back on itself.

 This is also known as a Caesar cypher.

### License Justification
I chose to use the MIT license with DoSomething so that I could maximize the usability of my code for others. I have no vested interests in profiting off of it in any way, so I went with a license that I believe granted the most liberties to those who want to use my code.
